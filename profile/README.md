## About
GRAM is a non-profit and volunteer-based initiative whose motive is to provide free education to the underprivileged class of students and empower them to go for stem fields.
## Who are we?
We are a group of students who seek to bring about a change by empowering young minds to pursue STEM as a career. We wish to build up a community that will rally for this cause and ultimately is one of the mediums through which STEM education is revolutionized in India and around the globe.
## Our vision
We are striving to provide free STEM education to students around the world while raising awareness too.
